and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2022-11-24

- Add `as_ref()` to `Validated`

### BREAKING CHANGES

- As `Validated` now has an inherent `as_ref()` method, code that
  used to call `AsRef::as_ref` on it may now behave differently.
  `AsRef` impl is still available and can be called explicitly,
  or simply use `Deref` instead.
